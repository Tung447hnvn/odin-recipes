    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Macarons are French-originated sweets made with finely ground almonds, confectioners's sugar and egg whites.<br>They are the most delicious soft cookies with crispy edges.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><em>3</em> egg whites</li>
        <li><em><small>1/4</small></em> cup white sugar</li>
        <li><em>1 <small>2/3</small></em> cups confectioners's sugar</li>
        <li><em>1</em> cup finely ground almonds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until foamy. Add white sugar and beat until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl; quickly fold almond mixture into egg whites, <b>about 30 strokes</b>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, <important>about 1 1/2 inches in diameter</important>, onto the prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold batter a few more times and retest.</p></li>
        <li><p>When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, <b>about 1 hour</b>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to <important>285 degrees F (140 degrees C)</important>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake cookies in preheated oven until set but not browned, <b>about 10 minutes</b>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Let cookies cool completely before filling, <b>about 30 minutes</b>.</p></li>
    </ol>
