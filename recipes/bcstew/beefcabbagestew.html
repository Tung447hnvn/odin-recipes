    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>This cabbage stew with tender beef and potatoes is a very good recipe.<br>My 93-year-old mother-in-law has recently told me that this is the best meal I have ever brought her, and there have been many.<br>All the veggie prep can be done while the onions and bay leaves are simmering. I do add more broth when the veggies go in. The cabbage will add a significant amount of water but the beef flavor is key.</p>
